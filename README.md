# Hello! 

# About us
We are Project Cognition, an student initiated SIV partnering with [Rare Disease Society Singapore (RDSS)](https://www.rdss.org.sg/).

# Why are we doing this?
People with rare diseases face many problems, from lack of awareness of the rare disease to lack of funding to support the costly medical fee. Due to lack of support and poor understanding of the issue, many of these patients face lack of support and get left out. About 0.4% of Singaporeans have rare diseases, and there are many that still do not receive help. Out of the 2000/3000 Singaporeans that have rare diseases, only 9 have received help from the Rare Disease Fund (RDF) since 2019. As such, more work needs to be done to ensure those patients live quality lives. We believe that everyone should have a fighting chance, and this SIV aims to raise awareness and funds to support them.
